= Braces

Bootstrap sinatra applications with a minimal template and rspec.

== Why?

Isn't Sinatra supposed to be super lightweight and easy to setup?  Yup,
it is; but it's nice to get everything else for free sometimes.

== Usage

Include:

    gem install braces

Run: 

    braces APP_NAME

Voila!
